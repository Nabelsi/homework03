    <h1>Once upon a time...</h1>

        Far out in the sea where the water is very deep, the Sea King ruled the
        undersea world. In the deepest spot of the sea was his castle. The walls
        were made of blue coral. On the roof were shells that opened and closed
        when the water passed by. And that is where the
        <span class="special">Sea King</span> lived with his mother and four
        daughters, each one born a year apart.
      </p>

      <p>
        The youngest of the four princesses was the <span id="span-control">Little Mermaid</span>.
        She spent much of her time swimming to ships that had fallen to the
        bottom of the sea. The ships held treasures from the world above! She
        would fill her arms and set up her collection here and there. All the
        while she would sing. As she did, fish circled around to hear her. For
        the <span id="span-control">Little Mermaid’s</span> voice was the most beautiful one under
        the sea.

        Soon the eldest sister turned 15. She was the first to be allowed to
        rise up to the surface. When she came back, she had many wonders to tell
        her sisters about!
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>She told about resting on soft white sand.</li>
        <li>High above was a deep blue sky with puffy white clouds.</li>
        <li>
          Later the sun set, she said, and the
          <strong class="strblue">whole sky turned gold and red</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong class="strblue">She had watched the birds fly high above her</strong>, dipping
          and making turns in the red and gold sky.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="special">When the next sister turned 15, it was winter.</p>
      <p>
        She told of icebergs floating in the sea and shining bright. All the
        ships stayed far away from the icebergs, she said, as if in fear. But
        the icebergs did not seem lonely. They were like friends, floating close
        to each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        All this the <span id="span-control">Little Mermaid</span> heard with wonder.
        <strong>It wasn’t fair that she had to wait the longest!</strong> At
        last the day came when she turned 15, too. Now she could rise up over
        the surface and see for herself. When she came up over the water,
        the<span id="span-control">Little Mermaid</span> was next to a large ship. On the ship
        beautiful music was playing. Sailors were dancing on the deck.
        <strong>They were laughing and having a fine time</strong>. It must be a
        party! Now and then as the waves lifted up the
        <span id="span-control">Little Mermaid</span>, she could see better. A handsome young man
        stepped out on the deck. When he did, a hundred rockets rose in the air.
        The party was for him. Was it his birthday? She swam closer.

        The men all seemed to like that young man. When he spoke, the sailors
        would laugh. Sometimes they patted him on his back in joy. Once that
        made his crown fall off. The men laughed and picked it up. “A crown,”
        said the <span id="span-control">Little Mermaid</span>.
        <span  class="special">“He must be a prince.”</span>
      </p>
      <p style=" color: orange; font-size: large;">
        Suddenly, it became very dark and the wind picked up. The sailors
        started to run about on deck. They pulled down the sail. The ship dipped
        and swooped. It rolled side to side, and up and down on the high waves.
